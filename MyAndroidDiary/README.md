This project pulled together everything I have learned so far about starting and configuring a project all the way through to using the text and design 
editor and running the app on an AVD and also a Google Pixel 4XL (Android 11)!

- To get this app on your Android device, download Android Studio.  
- Once the studio is downloaded, import this project on the studio   
- Make sure to do a pull using git bash or whatever you are comfortable with  
- Once the project opens up, connect your device to pc/mac  
- Press on build and then select your device from the drop  down list and press on run  
- This will install the app on your device and you can use it.
